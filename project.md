| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/10" target="_blank">CASCaDE Metamodel</a> | Development of schema and constraints as part of the standard | Submission Team |
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/6" target="_blank">CASCaDE Layered Ontology</a> | Development of concepts as part of the standard | Submission Team |
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/5" target="_blank">CASCaDE Reference Implementation</a> | Reference implementation | Validation Team |
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/8" target="_blank">CASCaDE Verification and Validation</a> | Verificiation and validation of the standard using the reference implementation | V&V Team |
