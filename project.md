# Project

The project organization and the tasks to complete the standard plus verification & validation 
using a commonly developed reference implementation are currently in discussion. 
So the following setup is preliminary.

## Focus Areas

Successful Standardization needs more than a Standard: A Reference Implementation plus Verification & Validation. 
Certification is needed later on once the standard is established and software products are developed and released.

## Teams

Three teams are responsible for the focus areas. It is important that a reference implementation is made available 
and V&V is done in parallel to preparing the standard. 

It‘s about collaboration, so let‘s collaborate.

Proposal for agile project management of the teams:

| Subproject | Description | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/10" target="_blank">CASCaDE Metamodel</a> | Development of schema and constraints as part of the standard | Submission Team |
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/6" target="_blank">CASCaDE Layered Ontology</a> | Development of concepts as part of the standard | Submission Team |
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/5" target="_blank">CASCaDE Reference Implementation</a> | Reference implementation | Validation Team |
| <a href="https://github.com/orgs/GfSE/projects/8" target="_blank">CASCaDE Verification and Validation</a> | Verificiation and validation of the standard using the reference implementation | V&V Team |

## Open Source ?

### Join Forces for Quality and Speed

Publicly available reference implementation and test cases support standard quality and speed of adoption.
Examples of successful collaborations are:
- The German Car Industry has built an ecosystem with a shared supply chain from the beginning. 
The sparking plug has been provided by Robert Bosch; the OEMs did not build it themselves.
- INSTA Elektro GmbH has been founded by competing GIRA, Jung and Berker to share the cost of electronics development (dimmers, timers etc.). 
- All web-browsers (Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Safari, Opera and many others) use one of the open-source engines Gecko, WebKit or Blink. 
Opera and even Microsoft have abandoned their own browser engine in favor of an open-source product.

Why should software-vendors develop the standard core-features of CASCaDE independently by themselves? And why debug towards interoperability later on? 

### Benefits of an Open-Source "Community Edition"
