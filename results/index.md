### 2024-12-13 OMG approves RfP

We are pleased to announce that the CASCaDE Request for Proposal (RfP) has been approved by the OMG Architecture Board (AB) and Technical Committee (TC). 
This is a major milestone on the way to standardize the collaboration in the product lifecycle from end to end.

Major ideas behind the RfP are explained <a href="../files/documents/2024-12%20CASCaDE-Introduction%20OMG.pdf" target="_blank" >here</a> 
and the RfP itself ist published on the <a href="https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?mantis/24-12-03.pdf" target="_blank" >OMG website</a>.

As a next step, a submission team for a standard will be formed. The associations GfSE, prostep ivip and VDA have announced their interest 
to cooperate and their readyness to cover travel and other expenses. Further funding is needed to 
develop a reference implementation for verification and validatation of the concepts to be submitted.
