### 2025-03-20 Metamodel Discussed at OMG TC Meeting in Reston VA

In Q1, the team of CASCaDE work-page one has prepared a draft metamodel for a knowledge graph 
containing interrelated product information from different sources. 
A major design goal is to reduce the graph's power of expression as much as permitted by the real world data,
so that the choice of technologies is as wide as possible. Requirements have been identified
to assess potential solutions. A simple example has been prepared for illustration and review.

Please have a look:
- Product Information Graph Metamodel (draft): <a href="https://specif.de/apps-alpha/edit#import=./2025-03-25%20Metamodel/Product%20Information%20Graph.specif.zip" target="_blank" >Online with Relations</a> and transformed to <a href="./2025-03-25%20Metamodel/" target="_blank" >HTML</a>.
- Very Simple Model with Requirements: <a href="https://specif.de/apps-alpha/edit#import="https://specif.de\examples\v1.2\09_Very-Simple-Model-FMC-with-Requirements.specif.zip" target="_blank" >Online with Relations</a> and transformed to <a href="https://github.com/GfSE/CASCaDE-Verification-and-Validation/blob/main/Very-simple-Model-with-Requirements%20%5BFMC%20-%20SpecIF%5D/7_RDF/Project%20'Very%20Simple%20Model%20(FMC)%20with%20Requirements'.ttl" target="_blank" >RDF</a>.

As a next step, an ontology shall be developed to map the concepts of different domains to the integrated graph 
and the metamodel shall be verified and validated with real world data. Towards this end we urgently need help by 
companies developing and offering mechatronic products (the 'users') and interested software vendors.

### 2024-12-13 OMG approves RFP

We are pleased to announce that the CASCaDE Request for Proposal (RFP) has been approved 
by the OMG Architecture Board (AB) and Technical Committee (TC). 
This is a major milestone on the way to standardize the collaboration in the 
product lifecycle from end to end.
A controlled vocabulary and a common context for so far partial product data are in focus.

Major ideas behind the RFP are explained <a href="../files/documents/2024-12%20CASCaDE-Introduction%20OMG.pdf" target="_blank" >here</a> 
and the RFP itself ist published on the <a href="https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?mantis/24-12-03.pdf" target="_blank" >OMG website</a>.

Members of prostep ivip and GfSE have prepared the RFP document in the past months.

As a next step, a submission team for a standard will be formed. The associations GfSE, 
prostep ivip and VDA have agreed to sponsor the effort. The team is looking for further funding to 
accurately verify and validate the concepts to be submitted.
