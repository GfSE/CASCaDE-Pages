### 2024-12-13 OMG approves RFP

We are pleased to announce that the CASCaDE Request for Proposal (RFP) has been approved 
by the OMG Architecture Board (AB) and Technical Committee (TC). 
This is a major milestone on the way to standardize the collaboration in the 
product lifecycle from end to end.
A controlled vocabulary and a common context for so far partial product data are in focus.

Major ideas behind the RFP are explained <a href="../files/documents/2024-12%20CASCaDE-Introduction%20OMG.pdf" target="_blank" >here</a> 
and the RFP itself ist published on the <a href="https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?mantis/24-12-03.pdf" target="_blank" >OMG website</a>.

Members of prostep ivip and GfSE have prepared the RFP document in the past months.

As a next step, a submission team for a standard will be formed. The associations GfSE, 
prostep ivip and VDA have agreed to sponsor the effort. The team is looking for further funding to 
accurately verify and validate the concepts to be submitted.
