# Examples

## Libraries

A simple example showing the process of an ontology-based application:
1. Defining an application ontology, here library, asset and author,
2. Managing application data, here the libraries with their books and authors, 
3. Using the application data, for example querying the books available in a given library.

A [process description](./libraries/index.html) is given with links to web editors and the example data.
